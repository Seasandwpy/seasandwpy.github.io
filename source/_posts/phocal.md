Object pose estimation is crucial for robotic applications and augmented reality. To provide a benchmark with high-quality ground truth annotations to the community, we introduce a multimodal dataset for category-level object pose estimation with photometrically challenging objects termed PhoCaL. PhoCaL comprises 60 high quality 3D models of household objects over 8 categories including highly reflective, transparent and symmetric objects. We developed a novel robot-supported multi-modal (RGB, depth, polarisation) data acquisition and annotation process. It ensures sub-millimeter accuracy of the pose for opaque textured, shiny and transparent objects, no motion blur and perfect camera synchronisation.
