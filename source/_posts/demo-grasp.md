Current 6D pose estimation networks support only a limited number of objects and require much training with either synthetic or real annotations, which is not suitable for robotic grasping in changing indoor environments. Therefore, we propose a method to estimate object shape along with grasp points on the fly with a sequence of RGB-D images. The learned knowledge is then leveraged to guide the robot to detect and grasp the object in the real environment. We conducted exhaustive experiments in both synthetic and real environments and our method outperforms SOTA grasping networks.
