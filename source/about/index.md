# Research Interest
I am a PhD student at TUM CAMP working on 6D pose estimation of object for robotic applications. We have been working closely with our industry partners on cutting edge problems dealing with large amounts of objects. Feel free to contact me if you are instered in object pose estimation and have experience in 3D computer vision.
